# Authentication and Minting with PKP Lit

Welcome to our repository for authentication and minting with PKP Lit! This project aims to provide a secure and efficient way to authenticate users and mint tokens using PKP Lit technology.

## What is PKP Lit?

PKP Lit stands for Public Key Pinning with Limited Trust. It is a cryptographic protocol that allows for secure communication between two parties by using public key cryptography. This technology is widely used in the financial and banking industries to ensure secure transactions.

## How does it work?

Our project utilizes PKP Lit to authenticate users and mint tokens. The process involves generating a unique public and private key pair for each user. The public key is then used to verify the user's identity, while the private key is used to sign and mint tokens.

## Why use PKP Lit for authentication and minting?

PKP Lit offers several advantages over traditional authentication and minting methods. Firstly, it provides a higher level of security as each user has a unique key pair, making it difficult for hackers to gain access. Additionally, PKP Lit is more efficient as it eliminates the need for multiple authentication steps, making the process faster and more streamlined.
